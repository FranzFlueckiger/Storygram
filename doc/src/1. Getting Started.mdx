# Getting Started

The Storygram allows you to explore and visualize sequential groupings in your data.

Make shure to give a look to our [examples](https://storygram-demo.netlify.app/) and the beta version of our [interactive storygram explorer](https://storygram-explorer.netlify.app/).

In the example below an excerpt of the career of Bass Player Marcus Miller is shown. Data courtesy from [metason.net](https://metason.net/). Feel free to change the code below to familiarize with the Storygram's functionality. You'll be able to do so through the whole documentation.

<Playground>
<StorygramGUI 
  data={MetasonData()}
  config={{
    dataFormat: 'array',
    eventField: 'release_year',
    actorArrayField: 'participants',
    filterGroupAmt: [3, undefined],
    filterGroupSize: [5, 15],
    filterEventValue: [1982, 1989],
    eventDescription: event =>
      event.data.release_title + ', ' + event.data.release_year,
    url: (event, actor) =>
      'https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=' + String(actor.actorID),
    eventUrl: (event) => 'https://www.google.ch/search?q=' + event.data.release_title + " " + event.eventValue,
    filterActorCustom: actor => actor.actorID !== 'Marcus Miller',
    marginRight: 300,
  }}
></StorygramGUI>
</Playground>

After playing around with the code you might have noticed two things:

The Storygram doesn't look always the same. This is due to the fact that it tries to optimize the clarity of the visualization by reducing edge crossings.

The size of the Storygram is set automatically based on the amount of actors and events to be visualized.
