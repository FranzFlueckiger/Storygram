# Filtering

It is possible to filter the events and actors of a Storygram in different ways.

## Event value filter
// event filter (positive and Negative event ranges possible)
filterEventValue: [number | string | undefined, number | string | undefined];

<Playground>
  <StorygramGUI data={[
    {event: 0, actors: ['a', 'b', 'c']},
    {event: 1, actors: ['d', 'b', 'e']},
    {event: 2, actors: ['d', 'a']}
  ]}
  config={ {
    dataFormat: 'array',
    eventField: 'event',
    actorArrayField: 'actors',
    filterEventValue: [1, undefined]
  }}></StorygramGUI>
</Playground>

## Group size filter
// event filter (positive group sizes only)
filterGroupSize: [number | undefined, number | undefined];

## Actor grouping amount filter
// actor filter (Positive group amounts only)
filterGroupAmt: [number | undefined, number | undefined];

## Actor interacted with filter
// check if the actors interacted with the given ones at the specified depth
interactedWith: [string[], number | undefined];

## Event must contain actors filter
// check if the event contains all the given actors
mustContain: string[];

## Event must contain actors filter
// check if the event contains one of the given actors
shouldContain: string[];

## Custom Event filter
// event filter for boolean predicates
filterEventCustom: (event: Event) => boolean;

## Custom actor filter
// actor filter for boolean predicates
filterActorCustom: (actor: Actor) => boolean;
